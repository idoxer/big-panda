# Development

1. Clone the project with `https://github.com/idoxer/big-panda.git`
2. In the cloned folder install the requirement npm modules `npm install`
3. Start the server locally `npm start` _(it will open the page once it finished initializing)_


**Note:** The project will be watched and inject any changes whether its css or js changes. (only when started with `npm start`)


The current exercise is only tested on chrome.
